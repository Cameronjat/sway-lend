# Supplying & Earning

### How to supply?

1. Go to the [Dashboard](https://app.swaylend.com/#/dashboard) page.
2. If you want to supply a base token such as USDC, click on the "Supply USDC" button (if available with a positive USDC balance in your account).
3. Enter the amount you want to supply. The same process applies to collateral tokens, but the action button can be found with the plus symbol in the assets table.
4. Submit the transaction and wait for it to be confirmed. Once confirmed, your supply is registered and you start earning interest.

{% hint style="info" %}
There is no minimum or maximum limit for supplying assets, but it's recommended to consider the transaction cost for low amounts, as it may be higher than the expected earnings.

### How to withdraw?

1. Go to the [Dashboard](https://app.swaylend.com/#/dashboard) page.
2. Click on "Withdraw USDC" or the minus symbol in the token table.
3. Enter the amount you want to withdraw.
4. Submit the transaction.

{% hint style="info" %}
Make sure there is enough liquidity in your account before withdrawing, otherwise you will need to wait for more liquidity from suppliers or borrowers repaying.
