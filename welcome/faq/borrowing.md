# Borrowing

## Why would I borrow instead of selling my assets?

Borrowing tokens instead of selling them offers several advantages. When you sell an asset, you close your position on that particular asset and forego any potential future gains. On the other hand, borrowing tokens allow you to obtain liquidity without having to sell your assets. This is useful for things like covering unexpected expenses, leveraging your holdings, or investing in new opportunities.

## How to borrow?

To borrow, you need to first supply an asset as collateral. After this, go to the Borrow section and select the asset you want to borrow. Enter the amount you need based on your available collateral. There will be a suggestion indicating the maximum you can borrow with the collateral you have provided.

## How much I can borrow?

The maximum amount you can borrow depends on the value you have supplied and the available liquidity. You won't be able to borrow an asset if there's not enough liquidity or if your health factor doesn't allow it. To check the specific parameters for borrowing each collateral asset, you can look at the risk parameters section. Additionally, you can find information on each token by clicking on its name in the assets table.

### What asset do I need to repay?

To repay your loan, you'll need to return the exact same asset you borrowed. For instance, if you borrowed 1 ETH, you'll need to repay that exact amount plus any accumulated interest.

### When is repayment of the loan required?

There is no set deadline for paying back the loan. As long as your collateral is sufficient, you can keep the loan for an indefinite period. However, as the interest accrues, the amount owed increases and your collateral might become at risk of liquidation.

## How do I payback the loan?

To repay your loan, head to the Borrow section in your dashboard. Then, select the base asset you borrowed and click on the repay button. Choose the amount you'd like to repay and confirm the transaction.
