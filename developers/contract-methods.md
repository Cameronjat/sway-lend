# Contract overview

The architecture of Sway Lend has been rewritten from the Ethereum lending protocol solution [Compound](https://compound.finance/) v3 to the Sway programming language. There are some differences in the number types due to Fuel's native asset system working on a 64-bit word size.&#x20;

This documentation will cover two topics related to the Sway Lend contracts: contract methods and storage entities.&#x20;

The contract methods section will discuss the functions available to interact with the contracts.

&#x20;In the storage entities section, we will explore the data stored by the contracts and the relationships between different storage values.
