# Sway Lend Intro

Sway Lend is a decentralized protocol for lending and borrowing crypto.

**Suppliers** who provide assets receive passive income from the interest paid by borrowers.

**Borrowers** can obtain assets without selling the assets they have. For example, if someone holds ETH, they can use it as collateral to borrow USC which they can then use to participate in the IDO of a new promising token.

Sway Lend is built on the Fuel blockchain which provides fast transactions and extremely low network fees â€” just a few cents per transaction.
