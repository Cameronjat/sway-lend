# Sway Lend Protocol
The Sway Lend Protocol is an Fuel Network smart contract for supplying or borrowing assets. Through the cToken contracts, accounts on the blockchain supply capital to receive cTokens or borrow assets from the protocol (holding other assets as collateral). The Compound cToken contracts track these balances and algorithmically set interest rates for borrowers.
